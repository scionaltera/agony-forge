# The following greeting will be displayed whenever someone connects to the game for the first time. Lines starting
# with # are treated as comments and will be ignored. Spaces will be replaced with non-breaking spaces (&nbsp;) so that
# you can include things like ASCII art. If you do not want non-breaking spaces you may begin the line with an
# asterisk (*) and it will get regular spaces instead.
